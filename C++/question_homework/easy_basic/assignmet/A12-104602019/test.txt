¡§Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday,¡¨the president tweeted. ¡§They were caught red handed.¡¨

He added: ¡§CNN¡¦S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. 
Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public.
 There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. 
Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!¡¨

The CNN report said Trump¡¦s son, Donald Trump Jr, received an email offering him access to hacked Democratic party emails from WikiLeaks before the documents had been made publicly available.
